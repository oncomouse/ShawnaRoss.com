_EMAPP is an international collaborative project that will create and present research on twentieth-century publishing in order to promote new ways of organizing, interacting with, and using historical information about book culture. The six collaborators, Claire Battershill and Nicola Wilson at the University of Reading in the UK, Elizabeth Willson-Gordon at King's University in Canada and Alice Staveley and Mike Widner at Stanford and Helen Southworth at the University of Oregon in the US have received support from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The first piece of the project focuses on The Hogarth Press._

_Here is a truth now universally acknowledged: that the whole of our cultural inheritance has to be recurated and reedited in digital forms and institutional structures.... [T]extual and editorial scholarship, often marginalized in humane studies as a narrowly technical domain, should be shifted back to the center of humanist attention.... We’ve been experimenting with jerry-rigged approaches for over twenty years. But as the digitization of the traditional archive has gained inertia...the problem for humanists has not diminished—if anything, it has grown more urgent._

_[Placing texts online can be] a major contribution to scholarship without being a scholarly edition per se._
