> Big business is today a healthy, moral organism… [G]enuine liberation in the forms and rhythms is furnished by constructional methods [reflecting] the true, profound laws of architecture…. The man of today is conscious of a new world forming regularly, logically and clearly...yet he finds himself living in an old, hostile environment, hindering him from following in his leisure what he pursues in his work, from following in his leisure this organic development to live an organized family life.

> There is only one hotel in America.... If the passage outside your bedroom door, or hallway as it is called, contains, let us say, a small table with a green vase and a stuffed flamingo, or some trifle of the sort, you may be perfectly certain that there is exactly the same table, vase and flamingo on every one of the thirty-two landings of that towering habitation. This is where it differs most, perhaps, from the crooked landings and unexpected levels of the old English inns.

> To me there was something weird, like a magic multiplication, in the exquisite sameness that...suggests the still atmosphere of some eerie psychological story. I once myself entertained the notion of a story, in which a man was to be prevented from entering his house (the scene of a crime or some calamity) by people who painted and furnished the next house to look exactly like it.... I came to America and found an hotel fitted and upholstered throughout for the enactment of my phantasmal fraud. I offer the skeleton of my story with all humility to some of the lady-writers of detective stories in America.

> Surely it might be possible for the unsophisticated Nimrod K. Moose... [to] be entangled somehow in this net of repetitions or recurrences. Surely something tells me that his beautiful daughter, the Rose of Red Murder Gulch, might seek for him in vain amid the apparently unmistakeable surroundings of the thirty-second floor, while he was being quietly butchered by the floor-clerk on the thirty-third floor, an agent of the Green Claw...and all because the two floors looked exactly alike to the virginal Western eye.

> the identification of escape, pleasure and relaxation with leisure was simply another kind of moral regulation, with the result that...we were never sure if we were free enough or far enough from that which we wished to escape.

> Being at Leisure is but a name for being active from an inner impulse instead of a necessity; moving like a dancer or skater for the sake of one's inner rhythm instead of moving, like a ploughman or an errand-boy, for the sake of the wages you get for it. Indeed, for this reason, the type of all Leisure is art.

> His return begins to be looked for, it can't be for some days. I might, you see, perfectly have waited a week; might have beaten a retreat as soon as I got this essential knowledge. But I beat no retreat; I did the opposite; I stayed, I dawdled, I trifled; above all I looked round. I saw, in fine, and—I don't know what to call it—I sniffed. It's a detail, but it's as if there were something—something very good—to sniff.

> “You see, Robert, once upon a time this little elephant was a real big live elephant, and he worked so hard in the jungle carrying tree-trunks in his own trunk...that some nice kind magician said he deserved a rest, so he turned him into a tiny elephant for me to wear on my bracelet.”
