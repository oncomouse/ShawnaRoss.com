# Rapid Prototyping

is a strategy whereby you swiftly erect a relatively stable inferface to manufacture temporary mock-ups that model proposed functionalities _up to a semi-usable form_ so that you do not waste time building something that is wrong.

---

# Rapid Prototyping: Advantages

1. Minimizes initial investment (time and money)
1. Leverages enthusiasms as they occur
1. Enables user reviews/responses at early stage
1. Clarifies ideals and scope of project
1. Produces deliverable to legitimize funding requests/applications

---

# Rapid Prototyping: Disadvantages

1. Could "waste" time on temporary/abandoned forms
1. Could enable habits or workflows that must be unlearned
1. Could disincentivize move to the second, permanent stage

---

# Rapid Prototyping: Methods

## Should be free, ubiquitous, easy to use and disseminate

1. Collaborative editing tools: Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox
1. CMS: Omeka, Drupal, even Wordpress
1. Library resources and bibliographies (Zotero)

---

# Consistent Metadata and Documented Workflows

1. Standardize objects in your archive
1. Enable unforeseen operations and functionalities
1. Instruct future collaborators
1. Abstract general tips and strategies for other projects

---

# Metadata: "Data about Data"

1. Think about bibliographies
1. Where did your object come from?
1. What are its structural characteristics?
1. Tailored to purpose/object
  1. Image: resolution, photographer
  1. Text: publisher, publication date
  1. Archival object: donor, date of accession

---

# Consistent Metadata

1. Document metadata in each format
  1. Markdown: Beginning of your .md file
  1. TEI: In the TEI header 
1. Divide into Required and Optional Metadata
  1. Required: Document will implode without it
  1. Optional: Features that may not be relevant for all of your objects


---

# Metadata for Your Project

1. Adaptable: it should respond to the varying needs of each text
1. Flexible: slightly different information for different genres (poem, manifesto, novel)
1. Linked: eventually could be tied to style/presentation information at front end (CSS)
  1. Files will be simpler, documentation more efficient
1. Consider the [Dublin Core Schema](http://dublincore.org/)
  1. Practical to select an existing schema to customize
  
---

# More Metadata = More Power

  1. Can be submitted to more tools
  1. Can generate automatic tables of contents

## Keep Emphasis on Descriptive Markup!

---

# A Workflow

is an explicit and complete declaration of an ordered series of actions you take on your project. Ideally, it will contain references to program choices, data input, interactions between programs and files (the passage of files among programs and users), error checking acivities, and data preservation strategies.

---

# Documented Workflows

1. Begin even before you think you need to
1. Try to use same file format (e.g., .md) or program (e.g., TextMate) as other objects
1. Update consistently
  1. Anticipate endless changes, especially at beginning
  1. Problems are opportunities for learning (really!)

---

# Workflow for Your Project

1. Write them for strangers, not for yourself
1. Start small and establish good habits before scaling out
1. Do everything digitally!
1. Should encompass rationale (why?) even if only implicitly
1. Always include provision for keeping data somewhere else than your own hard drive

---

# Political Issues: Turf Wars

1. Stay polite. 
  1. When necessary for copyright or goodwill, seek out "stakeholders."
1. Don't be railroaded. Don't give up!
  1. It may just take time or a due acknowledgment of prior scholarship!
  
---
  
# Turf War Strategies

1. Use "stakeholders" to solve problems for you
  1. They work, too, and can help you avoid feature creep
1. Keep focus on what you actually want to achieve
  1. May have to sacrifice organic/total vision to reach most important goal

---

# Political Issues: Respect

1. Textual editing historically not the most glamorous task
1. Some may doubt if encoding is "actually" work 
1. You may be regarded as doing "service"

---

# Respect Strategies: Scholarly Values

## Repeat after me: Digital Editions Are Scholarship.

1. They interpret and analyze a text
1. They update texts for the next generation
  1. Your choices have inherent political and social effects
1. They ensure the continued presence of literature on the web
1. They provide a beginning for further new scholarship
   1. Enable new uses for texts: visualizations, calculations, concordances, maps
   
---

# Respect Strategies: Practical Talking Points

1. The Public!
  1. Public outreach (open-source texts)
  1. Community service (appeal to regional interests or needs)
  1. Crowdsourcing (bring the public into the academic sphere)
1. Money!
  1. Grant funding
  1. Let us take care of making the deans happy for you
1. If all else fails, quote from Jerome McGann's _A New Republic of Letters_. Non-DH people are impressed by it.

# Here's Where You Come In

## The Modernist Sourcebook

---

# ModSource: Initial Innocent Query

Jonathan Morse asks the Modernist Studies Association group for

> an anthology of primary sources (not just backgrounds or criticism) for a senior-level introduction to modernist literature, primarily in English..[because existing anthologies have] eccentric selections, unfocused intorductions, fine print, no pictures, and typos and editorial errors on almost every page.

---

# ModSource: The Problem

Jane Marie Garrity chimes in, noting that she and her collaborators

> have encountered some resistance from publishers who...cannot make the finances work. Many of the primary sources that we are interested in bringing back into print are not readily available.... We have also been told that scholarly editions that bring individual writers further up the research ladder are more likely to be published than...'forgotten' and 'noncanonical' figures. In short, I think that publishers' commissioning priorities will need to change if everyone's anthology desires are to be met. 

---

# ModSource: The Need Emerges

## Bypass publishers, who will kill innovation at every step

1. Open & Free
1. Fast & Light
1. Eclectic & Inclusive

---

# ModSource: The Answer

James Gifford suggests an online answer. Your own Stephen Ross suggests

> a creative-commons site where you can essentially build-a-book from an existing library of materials in the public domain.

The email list promptly blows up. Conversation extends to Twitter.

---

# ModSource: The Concept

1. Open up the anthology
1. Low scaffolding: as "quick and dirty" as is consistent with quality 
1. Mostly remote collaboration among MSA members
1. All interested will contribute files; tech savvy will contribute code
1. Must avoid feature-creep to get the job done

---

# ModSource: A Proposed Workflow

## Thanks to your professor

1. Receive PDF files from MSA members
  * Method depends on tech-savviness of provider: meet these people where they are
1. Gather files on GibHub for Groups page
1. Convert PDFs to plain text
  * May use OCR/conversion program for bulk transformation of PDF into plain text tile
1. Convert plain text files to Markdown files
  1. Some hand-encoding necessary
  1. Commit to GitHub
1. Slap up prototype website
  1. Use Jekyll
  1. Solicit user reviews
1. Develop modernistsourcebook.org or the like
  1. Database-driven application using specific style sheets depending on genre
  1. Develop on Ember, Backbone, etc, any app that lets you run Ruby on Rails in your browser
  1. Offload backend requireemnts - may not need complicated server system

---

# ModSource: Potential Futures

1. Create Individualized Coursepacks
  1. Track texts
  1. Track users
  1. Track coursepacks
1. Enrich the texts
  1. Variants
  1. Multiple outputs
  1. Critical apparatuses
  1. Author-specific stylesheets

# Digital Editions are Textual Activism

# Conclusions

1. Your class is fundamental for this project.
1. It's all about people, places, and desires.
1. Questions?
