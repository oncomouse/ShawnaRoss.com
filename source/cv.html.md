## Book Projects

_Leisured Fictions: Working at Play in British Literature, 1840-1960_ explores leisure—free time that isn’t free—as a literary trope emerging out of the historical appearance of a variety of new leisure spaces (particularly hotels, ocean liners, and seaside resorts) and of a public discourse evaluating these new developments, are taken up in the work of Charles Dickens, W. M. Thackeray, G. K. Chesterton, Henry James, E. M. Forster, Wyndham Lewis, Elizabeth Bowen, Katherine Mansfield, and Evelyn Waugh. For these writers, leisure serves not only as a prominent mode of aesthetic, economic, and social investment in Great Britain, but also as a fundamental field through which transnational relationships were forged and conceptualized. Adapting theoretical frameworks from space theory, critical leisure studies, and actor-network theory, as well as mining ocean liner archives to reconstruct the visual culture of crossing and cruising, _Leisure Fictions_ shows how leisure served as a powerful field for imagining and critiquing modernity, particularly through its dialectical relationship with philosophical and commercial concepts of modern labor.

_Reading Modernism with Machines_ is a collection of 7,000-word case studies I am co-editing with fellow digital humanist [James O’Sullivan](http://josullivan.org/). Distinguished from current collections on the digital humanities that focus primarily on methodology, tool use, and theory, this collection assembles case studies focused on interpretive outcomes that will materially contribute to discipline- and author-specific directions in Modernist Studies. Contributions about W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and others will juxtapose written argumentation with computer-generated visualizations and statistics to illuminate digital approaches scholars can take to investigate the international literary avant-garde of the early twentieth century. In doing so, _Reading Modernism with Machines_ will break new ground in discipline-specific digital humanities research.
