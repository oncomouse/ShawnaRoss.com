## Book Projects

_Leisure Fictions: Hotels, Ocean Liners, and the Scene of Transatlantic Modernism_ explores how, for transatlantic nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers, leisure serves not only as a prominent mode of aesthetic, economic, and social investment, but also as a fundamental field through which transnational relationships were forged and conceptualized.

_Charlotte Brontë at the Anthropocene_ argues that this author’s oeuvre, from the juvenilia to Villette, constructs a multispecies vision of nature/culture contact zones at the start of the Anthropocene and creates some of the first literary ecosystems animated by anthropogenic change. Four chapters show how Brontë engages with images of environmental devastation and climate change by narrating the interpenetration of human and nonhuman histories of Yorkshire. _Manuscript solicited by SUNY Press_.

_Humans at Work in the Digital Age: Forms of Digital Textual Labor_ is a collection I am co-editing with Andrew Pilsch, featuring historical, cultural, and literary case studies that recuperate lost labor and laborers of early computer a technologies. _Under contract at Routledge for the Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities series_.

_[Using Digital Humanities in the Classroom: A Practical Introduction for Students, Teachers, and Lecturers](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/using-digital-humanities-in-the-classroom-9781350029743/)_ (Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), cowritten with Claire Battershill, is an introduction to teaching with digital humanities methods. It offers an approachable, step-by-step approach and is enhanced by a thorough, interactive Web Companion.

_[Reading Modernism with Machines](https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137595683)_ (Palgrave, 2016) is an edited collection, co-edited with James O’Sullivan, that, instead of focusing on methodology, tool use, and theory, assembles case studies focused on interpretive outcomes and interventions in ongoing scholarly debates on modernism.
