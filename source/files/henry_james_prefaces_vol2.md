“THE AMERICAN,” which I had begun in Paris early in
the winter of 1875-76, made its Hrst appearance in “ The
Atlantic Monthly” in June of the latter year and continued
there, from month to month, till l\/lay of the next. It started
on its course while much was still unwritten, and there again
come back to me, with this remembrance, the frequent
hauntings and alarms of that comparatively early time; the
habit of Wondering what would happen if anything should
“ happen,” if one should break one’s arm by an accident or
make a long illness or suffer, in body, mind, fortune, any
other visitation involving a loss of time. The habit of ap-
prehension became of course in some degree the habit of
confidence that one would pull through, that, with oppor-
tunity enough, grave interruption never yet /sad descended,
and that a special Providence, in short, despite the sad
warning of Thac'keray’s “ Denis Duval” and of Mrs. Gas-
kell’s “ Wives and Daughters ” (that of Stevenson’s _“ Weir
of I-Iermiston’7 Was yet _to come) watches over anxious
novelists condemned to the economy of serialisation. I make
myself out in memory as having at least for many months
and in many places given my Providence much to do : so
great a variety of scenes of labour, implying all so much
renewal of application, glimmer out of the book as I now
read it over. And yet as the faded interest of the Whole
episode becomes again mildly vivid what I seem most to
recover is, in its pale spectrality, a degree of joy, an eager-
ness on behalf of my recital, that must recklessly enough
have overridden anxieties of every sort, including any view p
of inherent difficulties.
I seem to recall no other like connexion in which the
case was met, to my measure, by so fond a complacency,
in which my subject can have appeared so apt to take care

altogether; must have buried my head in the sand and t ere

no doubt, is that Iwas more than commonly enamoured
of my idea, and that I believed it, so trusted, so lmaglnat- r
ively fostered, not less capable of limping to its goal on y
three feet than on one. The lameness might be what it i
would: I clearly, for myself, felt the thing go-- which IS

Vi esting c__a__se,‘¥abruptly enough, some years before: I recall i
sharply the’ elicity of the first glimpse, though I forget the
accident of thought that produced it. I recall that I Was
seated in an American “ horse-car ” when I found myself,
of a sudden, considering with enthusiasmiwas the theme of
a “ story,1’ the situation, in another country and an aristo-
Eratic society, of some robust but insidiously beguiled and
_ etrayed, some cruelly wronged, compatriot: the point being

self under his wrong   This would be the question involved, '
and I remember well how, having entered the horse-car
without a dream of it,I was presently to leave that vehicle
in full possession of my answer. l He would behave in the
most interesting manner--it would all depend on that: {'
stricken, smarting, sore, he would arrive at his just vindi- 5
cation and then would fail of all triumphantly and all vul-
garly enjoying it. He would hold his revenge and cherish it
and feel its sweetness, and then in the very act of forcing
it home would sacrifice it in disgust. He would let them
go, in short, his haughty contemners, even while feeling
them,with joy, in his power, and he would obey, in so doing,
one of the large and easy impulses genera/bf characteristic
of his type. He wouldn’t “ forgive ”-- that would have,
in the case, no application; he would simply turn, at the
supreme moment, away, the bitterness of his personal loss
yielding to the very force of his aversion. All he would
have at the end would be therefore just the moral conven-
ience, indeed the moral necessity, of his practical, but quite
unappreciated, magnanimity ; and one’s last view of him
would be that of a strong man indifferent to his strength
and too wrapped in fine, too wrapped above all in other
and intenser, reflexions for the assertion of his “ rights.’;§
This last point was of the essence and constituted in fact
the subject: there would be no subject at all, obviously,-or
simply the commonest of the common,_if my gentleman
should enjoy his advantage. I was charmed with my idea,
which would take, however, much working out; and pre-
cisely because it had so much to give, I think, must I have
dropped it for the time into the deep well of unconscious
cerebration : not without the hope, doubtless, that it might
eventually emerge from that reservoir, as one had already
known the buried treasure to come to light, with a firm
iridescent surface and a notable increase of weight.
This resurrection then took place in Paris, whereI was at
the moment living, and in December I 87 5; my good fortune
being apparently that Paris had ever so promptly offered

vel (sincel had come back there, after earlier visitations,
but a few weeks before), everything that was needed to make
my conception concrete. I seem again at this distant day
to see it become so quickly and easily, qu1t€ HS If lilllng
itself with life in that air. The objectivity it had wanted it
promptly put on, and if the questions had been, with the
usual intensity, for my hero and his crisis -- the whole for-
midable list, the who 3 the what P the where? the when P
the why P the how?-- they gathered their answers in the
cold shadow of the Arc de Triomphe, for fine reasons, very
much as if they had been plucking spring flowers for the
weaving of a frolic garland. I saw from one day to another
my particular cluster of circumstances, with the life of the
splendid city playing up in it like a flashing fountain in
a marble basin. The very splendour seemed somehow to
witness and intervene ; it was important for the effect of my
friend’s discomhture that it should take place on a high and
lighted stage, and that his original ambition, the project
exposing him, should have sprung from beautiful and noble
suggestions -those that, at certain hours and under certain
impressions, we feel the many-tinted medium by the Seine
irresistibly to communicate. It was all charmingly simple,
this conception, and the current must have gushed, full and
clear, to my imagination, from the moment Christopher New-
man irose before me, on a perfect day of the divine Paris
spring, in the great gilded Salon Carré of the Louvre. Under
this strong contagion of the place he would, by the happi-
est of hazards, meet his old comrade, now initiated and domi-
ciled; after which the rest would go of itself. If he was to
be wronged he would be wronged with just that conspicuity,
with his felicity at just that pitch and with the highest aggra-
vation of the general effect of misery mocked at. Great and
gilded the whole’ trap set, in fine, for his wary freshness
and into which it would blunder upon its fate. I have,
I_confess, no memory of a disturbing doubt; once the man
himself was imaged to me (and that germination is a process
almost always untraceable) he must have walked into the
situation as by taking a pass-key from his pocket.

But what then meanwhile would be the affront one would
S66 hlm as most feeling? The affront of course done him
2§ 3 lqvffr; and yet not that done by his mistress herself,
since injuries of thisorder are the stalest stuff of romance.
I.Was not to have him Jilted, any more than I was to have
him successfully vindictive : both his wron
would have been in these cases of too vulgar a type. I
doubtless even then felt that the conception of Paris _ag the
consecrated scene of rash infatuations and bold bad treach-
eries belongs, in the Anglo-Saxon imagination, to the infancy
of art. The right renovation of any such theme as that
would place it in Boston or at Cleveland, at Hartford or at
Utica- give it some local connexion in which we had not
already had so much of it. No, I should make my heroine
herself, if heroine there was to be, an equal victim -- just
as Romeo was not less the sport of fate for not having been
interestedly sacrificed by Juliet; and to this end I had but
to imagine “great people” again, imagine my hero con-
fronted and involved with them, and impute to them, with
a fine free hand, the arrogance and cruelty, the tortuous
behaviour, in given conditions, of which great people have
been historically so often capable. But as this was the
light in which they were to show, so the essence of the
matter would be that he should at the right moment find
them in his power, and so the situation would reach its
highest interest viiith the question of his utilisation of that
knowledge) It would be here, in the possession and appli-
cation of his power, that he would come out strong and
would so deeply appeal to our sympathy. Here above all
it really was, however, that my conception unfurled, with
the best conscience in the world, the emblazoned Hag of
romance; which venerable ensign it had, though quite
uffwiittingly, from the first and at every point sported in per-
fect good faith. I had been plotting arch-romance without
knowing it,‘,just as I began to write it that December day
without recognising it and just as I all serenely and bliss-
fully pursued the process from month to month and from
place to place; just as I now, in short, reading the book

over, find it yields me no interest and no reward comparable
to the fond perception of this truth.
(The thing is consistently, consummately -- and I would
i fain really make bold to say charmingly -- 1;QI;ljl&4lfl_l1lQ ; and
» all without intention, presumption, hesitation, contrition.
The effect is equally undesigned and unabashed, and I lose
myself, at this late hour, I am bound to add, in a certain
` sad envy of the free play of so much unchallenged instincts;
rr Une would like to woo back such hours of line precipita-
tion. They represent to the critical sense which the exercise
of one’s w/vale faculty has, with time, so inevitably and so
thoroughly waked up, the happiest season of surrender to the
invoked muse and the projected fable: the season of images
so free and confident and ready that they brush questions
aside and disport themselves, like the artless schoolboys of
Gray’s beautiful Ode, in all the ecstasy of the ignorance
attending them. The time doubtless comes soon enough
'when questions, as I call them, rule the roost and when the
little victim, to adjust Gray’s term again to the creature of
frolic fancy, does n’t dare propose a gambol till they have all
_ (like a board of trustees discussing a new outlay) sat on the
possibly scandalous case. Isomehow feel, accordingly, that
it was lucky to have sacrificed on this particular altar while
one still could ; though it is perhaps droll -in a yet higher
degree -- to have done so not simply because one was guile-
less, but e\/“en quite under the conviction, in a general way,
that, since no “ rendering” of any object and no painting
of any picture can take effect without some form of reference
and control, so these guarantees could but reside in a high
probity of observation. I must decidedly have supposed, all
the while, that I was acutely observing-and with a blest
absence of wonder at its being so easy. Let me certainly at
present rejoice in that absence; for I ask myself how with-
out it _I could have written “ The American.”

retrospect, to have remained F -or is it that I suffer the

hours, all acute impressions, to palm itself OH’ as the Sign of
2 finer Confidence than I could justly claim F It is a pleasure
to perceive how again and again the shrunken depths of
old Work yet permit themselves to be sounded or-- even
if rather terrible the image -- “ dragged ” ; the long pole of
memory stirs and rummages the bottom, and we fish up
such fragments and relics of the submerged life and the ex-
tinct consciousness as tempt us to piece them together. My
Windows looked into the Rue de Luxembourg -.___ Singe then
meagrely re-named Rue Cambon -- and the particular light
Parisian click of the small cab-horse on the clear asphalt,
with its sharpness of detonation between the high houses,
makes for the faded page to-day a sort of interlineation of
sound. This sound rises to a martial clatter at the moment
a troop of cuirassiers charges down the narrow street, each
morning, to Hle, directly opposite my house, through the plain
portal of the barracks occupying part of the vast domain
attached in a rearward manner to one of the Ministéres

along a considerable stretch of the street, by one of those

Perhaps that is why the novel, after all, was to achieve,
as it Went gn, no great--certainly no very direct-- trans..
fusion of the immense overhanging presence. It had to save
as it could its own life, to keep tight hold of the tenuous
I silver thread, the one hope for which was that it should n’t
be tangled or clipped. This earnest grasp of the silver
thread was doubtless an easier business in other places_
though as_I remount the stream of composition I see it
faintly coloured again: with the bright protection of the
Normandy coast (I worked away a few weeks at Etretat);
with the stronger glow of southernmost France, breaking
in during a stay at Bayonne; then with the fine historic
and other “ psychic ” substance of Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
a purple patch of terraced Cctober before returning to Paris.
There comes after that the memory of a last brief intense
invocation of the enclosing scene, of the pious effort to un-
wind my tangle, with a firm hand, in the very light (that
light of high, narrowish French windows in old rooms,
the light somehow, as one always feels, of ‘~‘ style ” itself)
that had quickened my original vision. I was to pass over
to London that autumn; which was_a reason the more for
considering the matter-the matter of Newman’s final
predicament- with due intensity : to let a loose end dangle
over into alien air would so fix upon the Whole, I strenu-
ously felt, the dishonour of piecemeal composition. There-
fore I strove to finish- first in a small dusky hotel of the
Rive Gauche, where, though the windows again were high,
the days were dim and the crepuscular court, domestic,
intimate, “ quaint,” testified to ancient manners almost as
if it had been that of Balzac’s Maison Vauquer in “ Le
Pere Goriot ”: and then once more in the Rue de Luxem-
bourg, where a black-framed Empire portrait-medallion,
suspended in the centre of each white panel of my almost
noble old salon, made the coolest, discreetest, most meas-
ured decoration, and where, through easements open to the
last mildness of the year, a belated Saint l\/Iartin’s summer,
the tale was taken up afresh by the charming light click
and clatter, that sound as of the thin, quick, quite feminine

PREFACE

surface-breathing of Paris,the shortest of rhythms for so huge
an organism.
Ishall not tell whether I did there bring my book to
a close--and indeed I shrink, for myself, from putting the
question to the test of memory. I follow it so far, the old
urgent ingenious business, and then I lose sight of it: from
which I infer-all exact recovery of the matter failing-
that I did not in the event drag over the Channel a length-
ening chain ; which would have been detestable. I reduce
to the absurd perhaps, however, by that small subjective
issue, any undue measure of the interest of this insistent
recovery of what I have called attendant facts. There always
has been, for the valid work of art, a history_though
mainly inviting, doubtless, but to the curious critic, for
Whom such things grow up and are formed very much in
the manner of attaching young lives and characters, those
conspicuous cases of happy development as to which evi-
dence and anecdote are always in order. The development n
indeed must be certain to have been happy, the life sincere,
the character fine: the work of art, to create or repay crit-
ical curiosity, must in short have been very “ valid ” indeed.
Yet there is on the other hand no mathematical measure
of that importance -- it may be a matter of widely-varying
appreciation; and I am willing to grant, assuredly, that
this interest, in a given relation, will nowhere so effectually
kindle as on the artist’s own part. And I am afraid that
after all even his best excuse for it must remain the highly
personal plea- the joy of living over, as a chapter of ex-
perience, the particular intellectual adventure. Here lurks
an immense homage to the general privilege of the artist,
to that constructive, that creative passion -portentous
Words, but they are convenient-the exercise of which
finds so many an occasion for appearing to him the highest
of human fortunes, the rarest boon of the gods. He values ~
it, all sublimely and perhaps a little fatuously, for itself --as
the great extension, great beyond all others, of experience
and of consciousness; with the toil and trouble a mere
sun-cast shadow that falls, shifts and vanishes, the result

X111

of his living in `so large a light. On the constant nameless
felicity of this Robert Louis Stevenson has, in an admirable
passage and as in so many other connexions, said the right
word: that the partaker of the “life of art” who repines
at the absence of the rewards, as they are called, of the
' pursuit might surely be better occupied. Much rather
should he endlessly wonder at his not having to pay half
his substance for his luxurious immersion. He enjoys it,
so to speak, Without a tax; the effort of labour involved,
the torment of expression, of which We have heard in
our time so much, being after all but the last refinement
of his privilege. It may leave him weary and Worn; but
how, after his fashion, he will have lived! As if one were
to expect at once freedom and easel That silly safety is
but the sign of bondage and forfeiture. Who can imagine
free selection --which is the beautiful, terrible 'whole of art
--Without free difficulty? This is the very franchise of
the city and high ambition of the citizen. The vision
of the difficulty, as one looks back, bathes one’s course in
a golden glow by which the very objects along the road are
transfigured and glorified; so that one exhibits them to other
eyes with an elation possibly presumptuous.
Since I accuse myself at all events of these complacencies
I take advantage of them to repeat that I value, in my re-
trospect, nothing so much as the lively light on the romantic
property of my subject that I had not expected to encounter.
If in “ The American ” I invoked the romantic association
Without malice prepense, yet with a production of the ro-
mantic effect that is for myself unmistakeable, the occasion
is of the best perhaps for penetrating a little the obscurity
of that principle. By what art or mystery, what craft of
selection, omission or commission, does a given picture of life
appear to us to surround its theme, its figures and images,
with the air of romance while another picture close beside
it may affect us as steeping the whole matter in the element
of reality? It is a question, no doubt, on the painter’s part,
very much more of perceived effect, effect ajier the fact,
than of conscious design -- though indeed I have ever failed

XIV '

to see how a coherent picture of anything is produciblc save
Eg if Cmnplex of fine measurements. The cause of the de-
degcionli in one pronounced sense or the other, must he
Pa 0W€ver; so that for the most part we recognise the
character of our interest only after the particular magic, as
I say, has_thoroughly operated --and then in truth but if
yVe_be a bit. critically minded, if we find our pleasure, that
is, in these intimate appreciations (for which, as I am well
aware, ninety-nine readers in a hundred have no use what-
ever). The determining condition would at any rate Seem
so_ latent that one may well doubt if the full artistic con-
sciousness ever reaches it; leaving the matter thus a case,
ever, not of an author’s plotting and planning and calculat-
ing, but just of his feeling and seeing, of his conceiving, in
a word, and of his thereby inevitably expressing himself,
under the influence of one value or the other. These values
represent different sorts and degrees of the communicable
thrill, and I doubt if any novelist, for instance, ever proposed
to commit himself to one kind or the other With as little
mitigation as We are sometimes able to find for him. The
interest is greatest --the interest of his genius, I mean,
and of his general Wealth - when he commits himself in
both directions ; not quite at the same time or to the same
effect, of course, but by some need of performing his Whole
possible revolution, by the law of some rich passion in him
for extremes. .
Of the men of largest responding imagination before the
human scene, of Scott, of Balzac, even of the coarse, com-

and all the Wit and all the adventure, we never can dlrectly

There have been, I gather, many definiuons of romance,
a matter indispensably of boats, or of caravans,or of tlgers,
or of “ historical characters,” or of ghosts, or of forgers, or
of detectives, or of beautiful wicked women, or of plstols
and knives, but they appear for the most part reduclble to
the idea of the facing of danger, the acceptance of great
risks for the fascination, the very love, of their uncertainty,
thejoy ofsuccess if possible and of battle in any case. This
would be a fine formula if it bore examination ; but it strikes
me as Weak and inadequate, as by no means covering the
true ground and yet as landing us in strange confusions.
The panting pursuit of danger is the pursuit of life itself,
in which danger awaits us possibly at every step and faces
us at every turn; so that the dream of an intenser experi-
ence easily becomes rather some vision of a sublime secur-
ity like that enjoyed on the flowery plains of heaven, Where
We may conceive ourselves proceeding in ecstasy from one
prodigious phase and form of it to another. And if it be
insisted that the measure of the type is then in the apprecia-
tion of danger#-the sign of our projection of the real being
the smallness of its dangers, and that of our projection of
the romantic the hugeness, the mark of the distinction being
in short, as they say of collars and gloves and shoes, the
size and “number” of the danger--this discrimination
agaln surely falls, s1n_ce it makes our difference not a differ-
.ence of kind, Wh1C;l'l IS what We Want, but a difference only
of degree, and subject by_that condition to the indignity of
a sliding scale and a sh1ft1ng measure, There are immense
xvi

bging but one of the a

and flagrant dangers that are but sordid and squalid ones, as
we feel, tainting with their quality the very defiances they
provoke; while there are common and covert onesa that
“look like nothing” and that can be but inwardly and QC-
cultly dealt with, which involve the sharpest hazards to l_1f€
and honour and the highest instant decisions and intrepid-
ities of action. It is an arbitrary stamp that keeps these
latter prosaic and makes the former heroic ; and yet I should
still less subscribe to a mere “ subjective” division--I
mean one that would place the diflerence wholly in the
temper of the imperilled agent. It would be impossible to
have a more romantic temper than Flaubert’s Madame Bo-
vary, and yet nothing less resembles a romance than the
record of her adventures. To classify it by that aspect --
the definition of the spirit that happens to animate her-- is
like settling the question (as I have seen it witlessly settled)
by the presence or absence of “costume/’ Where again
then does costume begin or end ?-- save With the “ run ”
of one or another sort of play? We must reserve vague
labels for artless mixtures.
The only general attribute of projected romance that I
can see, the only one that fits all its cases, is the fact of
the kind of experience with which it deals-experience
liberated, so to speak; experience disengaged, disembroiled,
disencumbered, exempt from the conditions that we usually
know to attach to it and, if We Wish so to put the matter,
drag upon it, and operating in a medium which relieves it,
in a particular interest,'of the inconvenience of a related, a
measurable state, a state subject to all our vulgar commun-
ities. The greatest intensity may so be arrived at evidently
-when the sacriice of community, of the “ related” sides
of situations, has not been too rash. It must to this end
not flagrantly betray itself ; We must even be kept if pos-
sible, for our illusion, from suspecting any sacrifice at all,
(The balloon of experience is in fact of course tied to the
earth, and under that necessity we swing, thanks to a rope
of remarkable length, in the more or less commodious car

venture, this hocus-pocus is attempted : the value of the in-
stance not being diminished either, surely, by its having been
attempted in such evident good faith. Yes, all is romantic
to my actual vision here, and not least so, I hasten to add,
the fabulous felicity of my candour. The Way things hap-

C0 which my narrative commits it; of which truth’ more,
over, I am by no means sure that, in spite of what I have
Called my Sefenitlb I had DOY all the while an uneas
suspicion. I had dug in my path, alas, a hole into Whici
I was destined to fall. I was so possessed of my idea that
Newman should be ill-used--which was the essence gf
my subject--that I attached too scant an importance to its
fashion of coming about. Almost any fashion would
serve, I appear to have assumed, that would give me my
mam chance for him; a matter depending not so much on
the particular trick played him as on the interesting face
presented by him to any damnable trick. So where I part
company with terra-yfrma is in making that projected, that
performed outrage so much more showy, dramatically speak-
ing, than sound. Had I patched it up to a greater apparent
soundness my own trick, artistically speaking, would have
been played 5 I should have cut the cable without my
reader’s suspecting it. I doubtless at the time, I repeat,
believed I had taken my precautions; but truly they should
have been greater, to impart the air of truth to the attitude
- that is first to the pomp and circumstance, and second
to the queer falsity - of the Bellegardes.
They would positively have jumped then, the Bellegardes,
at my rich and easy American, and not have “ minded”
in the least any drawback -- especially as, after all, given
the pleasant palette from which I have painted him, there
were few drawbacks to mind. My subject imposed on me
a group of closely-allied persons animated by immense pre-
tensions-- which was all very well, which might be full of
the promise of interest : only of interest felt most of all in
the light of comedy and of irony. This, better understood,
would have dwelt in the idea not in the least of their not
finding Newman good enough for their alliance and thence
being ready to sacrifice him, but in that of their taking
with alacrity everything he could give them, only asking

for more and more, and then adjusting their pretensions
and their pride to it with all the comfort in life. Such
accommodation of the theory of a noble indifference to the
practice of a deep avidity is the real note of policy in forlorn
aristocracies --- and I meant of course that the Bellegardeg
should be virtually forlorn. 'I`he perversion of truth is
by no means, I think, in the displayed acuteness of their
remembrance of “ who ” and “ what ” they are, or at any
rate take themselves for; since it is the misfortune of all
insistence on “ worldly ” advantages--and the situation of
such people bristles at the best (by which I mean under
\Vl111[L`\'Cl` invocation of a superficial simplicity) with em-
phasis, accent assumption- to produce at times an effect
of grossness. lThe picture of their tergiversation, at all
events, however it may originally have seemed to me to
hang together, has taken on this rococo appearance precisely
because their preferred course, a thousand times preferred,
would have been to haul him and his fortune into their boat
under cover of night perhaps, in any case as quietly and
with as little bumping and splashing as possible, and there
accommodate him with the very safest and most convenient
seat. 3 Given Newman, given the fact that the thing consti-
tutes itself organically as bis adventure, that too might very
well be a situation and a subject: only it would n’t have
been the theme of “ The American ” as the book stands,
the themesto which Iwas from so early pledged. Since
I had wanted a “ wrong ” this other turn might even have
been arranged to give me that, might even have been ar-
ranged to meet my requirement that somebody or something
should be “ in his power” so delightfully; and with the
signal effect, after all, of “ defining ” everything. (It is as
difficult, I said above, to trace the dividing-line between the
real and the romantic as to plant a milestone between north
and south; but I am not sure an infallible sign of the latter
is not this rank vegetation of the “ power” of bad people
that good get into, or “vice versa. It is so rarely, alas, into
our power that any one gets I)

to be the obscured ; by which I should largely get the very
effect most to be invoked, that of a generous nature engaged
with forces, with difficulties and dangers, that it but half
understands. If Newman was attaching enough, I must
have argued, his tangle would be sensible enough; for the
interest of everything is all that it is his vision, /:is concep-
tlon, his interpretation: at the window of his wide, quite
sufliciently wide, consciousness we are seated, from that
admirable position we “ assist.” He therefore supremely
matters ; all the rest matters only as he feels it, treats it,
meets it. A beautiful infatuation this, always, I think, the
intensity of the creative effort to get into the skin of the
Creature; the act of personal possession of one being by
another at its completest-and with the high enhance-
ment, ever, that it is, by the same stroke, the effort of the
artist to preserve for his subject that unity, and for his use
of it (in other words for the interest he desires to excite)
that effect of a centre, which most economise its value,,,
Its value is most discussable when that economy has
most operated; the content and the “ importance” of a
work of art are in fine wholly dependent on its being one:
outside of which all prate of its representative character, its
meaning and its bearing, its morality and humanity, are
an impudent thing. Strong in that character, which is the
condition of its really bearing witness at all, it is strong every
way. So much remains true then on behalf of my instinct
of multiplying the fine touches by which Newman should
live and communicate life; and yet I still ask mysfilfa I

everything is evaded, and the efl`ect of this, I f§C0gn1se, is
of the oddest. His relation to Madame dt? Clnffe fakes
a great stride, but the author appears to view that but as
a signal for letting it severely alone. _ _
I have been stupefied, in so thoroughly revising tl1C_b00k,
to find, on turning 3, page, that the light in which he is pre_
sented immediately after Madame de_ Bellegarde has con_
spicuously introduced him to all her circle as her daughters
husband-to-be is that of an e_ven1ng at tht? OPCFZ quite
alone; as if he would n’t surely spend his leisure, and espe_
cially those hours of it, with his intended. Instmctively,
from that moment, one would have seen them lntlmately
and, for one’s interest, beautifully together; Wlth some
illustration of the beauty incumbent on the author. The
truth was that at this point the author, all gracelessly,
could but hold his breath and pass ; lingering was too diHi_
cult-he had made for himself a crushing complication.
Since Madame de Cintré was after all to “ back out ” every
touch in the picture of her apparent loyalty would add to
her eventual shame. She had acted in clear good faith, but
how could I give the detail of an attitude, on her part, of
which the foundation was yet so weak P I preferred, as the
minor evil, to shirk the attempt-at the cost evidently of
a signal loss of “ charm ” ; and with this lady, altogether,
I recognise, a light plank, too light a plank, is laid for the
reader over a dark “ psychological” abyss. The delicate
clue to her conduct is never definitely placed in his hand :
I must have liked_verily to think it ‘was delicate and to flat-
ter myself it was to be felt with linger-tips rather than
heavily tugged at. Here then, at any rate, is the romantic

transform it for /vim into a positive illusion of the largest
liberty, and the success will ever be proportionate to the
chance. Unly all this gave me, I make out, a great deal to
look to, and I Was perhaps Wrong in thinking that Newman
by himself, and for any occasional extra inch or so I
might smuggle into his measurements, would see me
through my Wood. Anything more liberated and discon-
nected, to repeat my terms, than his prompt general profes-
sion, before the Tristrarns, of aspiring to a “ great ” marriage,
for example, could surely not Well be imagined. I had to
take that over with the rest of him and fit it in -I had
indeed to exclude the outer air. Still, I rind on re-perusal
that I have been able to breathe at least in my aching
void ; so that, clinging to my hero as to a tall, protective,
good-natured elder brother in a rough place, I leave the
record to stand or fall by his more or less convincing image.,
