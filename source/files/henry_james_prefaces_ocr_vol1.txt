PREFACE

“ RODERICK HUDSON ” was begun in Florence in the spring
of 1874, designed from the first for serial publication in
“ The Atlantic Monthly,” where it opened in _Ianuary 187 5
and persisted through the year. I yield to the pleasure of
placing these circumstances on record, as I shall place
,others, and as I have yielded to the need of renewing ac-
quaintance with the book after a quarter of a century. This
revival of an all but extinct relation with an early work may
often produce for an artist, I think, more kinds of interest .
and emotion than he shall find it easy to express, and yet
will light not a little, to his eyes, that veiled face of his
Muse which he is condemned for ever and all anxiously to
study. The art of representation bristles with questions the
very terms of which are diflicult to apply and to appreciate ;
but whatever makes it arduous makes it, for our refresh-
ment, inlinite, causes the practice of it, with experience, to
spread round us in a widening, not in a.narrowing circle.
Therefore it is that experience has to organise,-for con-
venience and cheer, some system of observation -- for fear,
in the admirable immensity, of losing its way. We see it as
pausing from time to time to consult its notes, to measure,
for guidance, as many aspects and distances as possible, as
many steps taken and obstacles mastered and fruits gathered
and beauties enjoyed. Everything counts, nothing is super-
fluous in such a survey; the explorer’s note-book strikes me
here as endlessly receptive. This accordingly is what I mean
'by the contributive value--or put it simply as, to one’s
own. sense, the beguiling charm---of the accessory facts in
a given artistic case. This is why, as one looks back, the
private history of any sincere work, however modest its pre-
tensions, looms with its own completeness in the rich, am-
biguous xsthetic air, and seems at once to borrow a dignity

and to mark, so to say, a station. This ‘is why, reading
over, for revision, correction and republication, thC v0l\1m€S
here in hand, I find myself, all attentively, in presence .of
some such recording scroll or engraved commemoratn/6
table--from which the “ private ” character, moreover,
quite insists on dropping out. These notes represent, Over
a considerable course, the continuity of an artist’s endeavour,
the growth of his whole operative consciousness and, bCSt
of all, perhaps, their own tendency to multiply, with the
implication, thereby, ofa memory much enriched. Addicted
to “ stories ” and inclined to retrospect, he fondly t21kCS»
under this backward view, his whole unfolding, his process
of production, for a thrilling tale, almost for a wondrous
adventure, only asking himself at what stage of remembrance
the mark of the relevant will begin to fail. He frankly
proposes to take this mark everywhere for granted. i
“Roderick Hudson” was my first attempt at a novel,
a long fiction with a “ complicated ” subject, and I recall
again the quite uplifted sense with which my idea, such as
it Was, permitted me at last to put quite out to sea. I had
but hugged the shore on sundry previous small occasions;
bumping about, to acquire skill, in the shallow waters and
sandy coves of the “ short story ” and master as yet of no
vessel constructed to carry a sail. The subject of “ Rod-
erick” figured to me vividly this employment of canvas,
and I have not forgotten, even after long years, how the
blue southern sea seemed to spread immediately before me
and the breath of the spice-islands to be already in the
breeze. Yet it must even then have begun for me too, the
ache of fear, that was to become so familiar, of being un-
duly tempted and led on by “ developments ” ; which is but
the desperate discipline of the question involved in them.
They are of the very essence of the novelist’s process, and
it is by their aid, fundamentally, that his idea takes form
and l1V_€S ;_ but they impose on him, through the principle
of continuity that rides them, a proportionate anxiety. They
are the _very condition of interest, which languishes and `
df0PS Wlthout them; the painter’s subject consisting ever,

- V1

l

obviously, of the related state, to each other, of certain fig-
ures and things. To exhibit these relations, once they have
all been recognised, is to “ treat ” his idea, which involves
neglecting none of those that directly minister to interest;
the degree of that directness remaining meanwhile a matter
of highly diflicult appreciation, and one on which felicity of
form and composition, as a part of the total effect, merci-
lessly rests. Up to what point is such and such a develop-
ment indispensable to the interest? What is the point be-
yond which it ceases to be rigorously so? Where, for the »
complete expression of one’s subject, does a particular rela-
tion stop _ giving way to some other not concerned in that
expression?
Really, universally, relations stop nowhere, and the ex-
quisite problem of the artist is eternally but to draw, by
a geometry of his own, the circle within which they shall
happily appear to do so. He is in the perpetual predicament
that the continuity of things is the whole matter, for him,
of comedy and tragedy; that this continuity is never, by
the space of an instant or an inch, broken, and that, to do
anything at all, he has at once intensely to consult and in-
tensely to ignore it. All of which will perhaps pass but for
a supersubtle way of pointing the plain moral that a young
embroiderer of the canvas of life soon began to work in
terror, f`airly,&of the vast expanse of that surface, of the
boundless number of its distinct perforations for the needle,
and of the tendency inherent in his many-coloured flow-
ers and figures _ to cover and consume as many as possible
of the little holes. The development of the flower, of the
figure, involved thus an immense counting of holes and
a careful selection among them. That would have been, it
seemed to him, a brave enough process, were it not the
very nature of the holes so to invite, to solicit, to persuade,
to practise positively a thousand lures and deceits. The
prime effect of so sustained a system, so prepared a sur-
face, is to lead on and on; while the fascination of fol- .
lowing resides, by the same token, in the presumability
.mmgwbere of a convenient, ofna visibly-appointed stopping-
, V11 l

place. Art would be easy indeed if, by_ a fond power dis-
posed to “patromse” it, such conveniences, such simpli-
fications, had been provided. We have, as the case stands, r
to invent and establish them, to arrive at them by a difli-
cult, dire process of selection and comparison, of surrender
and sacrifice. The very meaning of expertness IS acquired
courage to brace one’s self for the cruel crisis from the
moment one sees it grimly loom.
“ Roderick Hudson ” was further, was earnestly pursued
during a summer partly spent in the Black Forest and (as
I had returned to America early in September) during three
months passed near Boston. It is one of the silver threads
of the recoverable texture of that embarrassed phase, how-
ever, that the book was not finished when it had to begin
appearing in monthly fragments : a fact in the light of which »
I find myself live over again, and quite with wonderment
and tenderness, so intimate an experience of difliculty and
delay. To have “liked ” so much writing it, to have worked
out with such conviction the pale embroidery, and yet not,
at the end of so many months, to have come through,
was clearly still to have fallen short of any facility and any
confidence: though the long-drawn process now most ap-
peals to memory,I confess, by this very quality of shy and
groping duration. Une fact about it indeed outlives all
others; the fact that, as the loved Italy was the scene of
my fiction.- so much more loved than one has ever been
i able, even after fifty efforts, to say l --and as having had
to leave it persisted as an inward ache, so there was soreness I
in still contriving, after a fashion, to hang about it and in
prolonging, from month to month, the illusion of the golden
air. Little enough of that medium may the novel, read over n
;_°'daY» $36111 I0 Supply; yet half the actual interest lurks '
or me in the earnest, baffled intention of making it felt.
A whole side of the old consciousness, under this mild
Pressure; flushes UP and P1‘€Vails again; a reminder ever so
penetrating’ of the quantitl’ Of “ evocation ” involvdd in m
Eli? ’t§"a‘11§;vlh° i‘“a'¥“y I 'i`"“.¢V¢n have Supposed myi
. ta e the lingering perception of all this,

V111

I may add - that is of the various admonitions of the whole
reminiscence- for a signal instance of the way a WOfk of
art, however small, if but sufliciently sincere, may vivify
and even dignify the accidents and incidents of its growth.
I must that winter (which I again like to put on record
that I spent in New York) have brought up my last instal-
ments in due time, for I recall no haunting anxiety : what
I do recall perfectly is the felt pleasure, during those months
--and in East Twenty-fifth Street!-of trying, on the
other side of the world, still to surround with the appropriate
local glow the characters that had combined, to my vision,
the previous year in Florence. A benediction, a great ad-
vantage, as seemed to me, had so from the first rested on
them, and to nurse them along was really to sit again in the
high, charming, shabby old room which had originally over-
arched them and which, in the hot May and June, had
looked out, through the slits of cooling shutters, at the
rather dusty but ever-romantic glare of Piazza Santa Maria
Novella. The house formed the corner (I delight to spe-
cify) of Via della Scala, and I fear that what the early '
chapters of the book most “ render” to me to-day is not
the umbrageous air of their New England town, but the
view of the small cab-stand sleepily disposed- long before
the days of strident electric cars -- round the rococo obelisk
of the Piazza, which is supported on its pedestal, if I re- ~
member rightly, by four delightful little elephants. (That,
at any rate, is how the object in question, deprecating veri-
fication, comes back to me with the clatter of the horse-
pails, the discussions, in the intervals of repose under well-
drawn hoods, of the unbuttoned cacc/Jieri, sons of the most  
garrulous of races, and the occasional stillness as of the l
‘ noonday desert.)
Pathetic, as we say, on the other hand, no doubt, to re-
perusal, the manner in which the evocation, so far as at-
tempted, of the small New England town of my first :wg
chapters, fails of intensity--if intensity, in such a connex-
ion, had been indeed to be looked for. Could I verily, by
the terms of my little plan, have “ gone in” for it at the

IX

best, and even though one of these terms was the projection,
for my fable, at the outset, of some more or less vivid an-
tithesis to a state of civilisation providing for “ art ” ? What
I wanted, in essence, was the image of some perfectly
humane community which was yet all incapable of provid-
ing for it, and I had to take what my scant experience fur-
nished me. I remember feeling meanwhile no drawback in
this scantness, but a complete, an exquisite little adequacy,
so that the presentation arrived at would quite have served
its purpose, I think, had I not misled myself into naming
my place. To name a place, in fiction, is to pretend in
some degree to represent it-and I speak here of course
but of the use of existing names, the only ones that carry
weight. I wanted one that carried weight- so at least I  
supposed; but obviously I was wrong, since my effect lay, r
so superficially, and could only lie, in the local type, as to
which I had my handful of impressions. The particular I
local case was another matter, and I was to see again, after
long years, the case into which, all recklessly, the opening
passages of “ Roderick Hudson ” put their foot. I was to
have nothing then, on the spot, to sustain me but the rather
feeble plea that I had not pretended so very much to “ do ”
Northampton Mass. The plea was charmingly allowed,
but nothing could have been more to the point than the
way in which, in such a situation, the whole question of
the novelist’s~ “ doing,” with its eternal wealth, or in other
words its eternal torment of interest, once more came up.
He embarks, rash adventurer, under the star of “repre- 1
sentation,” and is pledged thereby to remember that the art
of interesting us in things -once these things are the y
right ones for his case - can onbf be the art of representing ~
them. This relation to them, for invoked interest, involves
his accordingly “ doing” ; and it is for him to settle with I
his intelligence what that variable process shall commit
him to.
Its fortune rests primarily, beyond doubt, on somebody’s r
having, under suggestion, a sense for it-even the reader
will do, on occasion, when the writer, as so often happens,

X .

completely falls out. The way in whigh this sense has
been, or has not been, applied constitutes, at all events,
in respect to any fiction, the very ground of critical appre-
ciation, Such appreciation takes account, primarily, of the
thlng, in the case, to have been done, and I now see what, `
for the first and second chapters of “ Roderick,” that Was.
If WHS 21 P€2C€f`L1l, rural New England community quelcongue
--it was not, it was under no necessity of being, North-
ampton Mass. But one nestled, technically, in those days,
and with yearning, in the great shadow of Balzac; his
august example, little as the secret might ever be guessed,
towered for me over the scene; so that what was clearer
than anything else was how, if it was a question of Saumur,
of Limoges, of Guérande, he “ did ” Saumur, did Limoges,
did Guérande. I remember how, in my feebler fashion, I
yearned over the preliminary presentation of my small
square patch of the American scene, and yet was not suf-
ficiently on my guard to see how easily his high practice
might be delusive for my case. Balzac talked of Nemours
and Provins: therefore Why should n’t one, with fond fatu-
ity, talk of almost the only small American 'ville de province
of which one had happened to lay up, long before,a pleased
vision? The reason was plain: one was not in the least,
in one’s prudence, emulating his systematic closeness. It
did n’t confuse the question either that he would verily,
after all, addressed as he was to a due density in his mate-
rial, have found little enough in Northampton Mass to
tackle. I-Ie tackled no group of appearances, no presented
face of the social organism (conspicuity thus attending it),
but to make something of it. To name it simply and not
in some degree tackle it would have seemed to him an act
reflecting on his general course the deepest dishonour.
Therefore it was that, as the moral of these many re-
marks, I “ named,” under his contagion, when I was really
most conscicius of not being held to it; and therefore it
was, above all, that for all the effect of representation I  
was to achieve, I might have let the occasion pass. A
“ fancy ” indication would have served my- turn-except
X1 ,

that Ishould so have failed perhaps of a pretext for my
present insistence. _ _
Since I do insist, at all events, I find this ghostly interest
perhaps even more reasserted for me by the questions be-
gotten within the very covers of the book, those that Wan-
der and idle there as in some sweet old overtangled walled
garden, a safe paradise of self-criticism. Here it is that if
there be air for it to breathe at all, the critical question
swarms, and here it is, in particular, that one of the happy
hours of the painter’s long day may strike. I speak of the
painter in general and of his relation to the old picture, the
work of hi_s hand, that has been lost to sight and that, when
found again, is put back on the easel for measure of what
time and the weather may, in the interval, have done to it.
Has it too fatally faded, has it blackened or “ sunk,” or
otherwise abdicated, or has it only, blest thought, strength-
ened, for its allotted duration, and taken up, in its degree,
poor dear brave thing, some shade of the all appreciable,
yet all indescribable grace that we know as pictorial “ tone” ?
The anxious artist has to wipe it over, in the first` place,
to see; he has to “ clean it up,” say, or to varnish it anew,
or at the least to place it in a light, for any right judgement
of its aspect or its worth. But the very uncertainties them-
selves yield a thrill, and if subject and treatment, working
together, have had their felicity, the artist, the prime creator,
may find a strange charm in this stage of the connexion.
It helps him to`live back into a forgotten state, into con-
victions, credulities too early spent perhaps, it breathes upon
the dead reasons of things, buried as they are in the texture
of the work, and makes them revive, so that the actual
appearances and the old motives fall together once more,
and a lesson and a moral and a consecrating final light are
somehow disengaged. “
All this, I mean of course, if the case will, wonderfully
take any such pressure, if the work does n’t break down
under even such mild overhauling. The author knows well
enough how easily that may happen--which he in fag;
p frequently enough sees it do. The old reasons then are too

X11

PREFACE

dead to revive; they were not, it is plain, good enough
reasons to live. The only possible relation of the present
mind to the thing is to dismiss it altogether. On the other
hand, when it is not dismissed--as the only detachment is
the detachment of aversion - the creative intimacy is re-
afiirmed, and appreciation, critical apprehension, insists on
becoming as active as it can. Who shall say, granted this,
where it shall not begin and where it shall consent to end?
The painter who passes over his old sunk canvas the wet
sponge that shows him what may still come out again makes
his criticism essentially active. When having seen, while
his momentary glaze remains, that the canvas bas kept a
few buried secrets, he proceeds to repeat the process with
due care and with a bottle of varnish and a brush, he is
“ living back,” as I say, to the top of his bent, is taking
up the old relation, so workable apparently, yet, and there
is nothing logically to stay him from following it all the way.
I have felt myself then, on looking over past productions,
the painter making use again and again of the tentative wet
sponge. The sunk surface has here and there, beyond
doubt, refused to .responds the buried secrets, the inten-
tions, are buried too deep to rise again, and were indeed, it
would appear, not much worth the burying. Not so, how-
ever, when the moistened canvas does obscurely Hush and
when resort to the varnish-bottle is thereby immediately
indicated. The simplest figure for my revision of this pre-
sent array of earlier; later, larger, smaller, canvases, is to say
that I have achieved it by the very aid of the varnish-bottle.
It is true of them throughout that, in words I have had oc-
casion to use in another connexion (where too I had revised
with a view to “ possible amendment of form and enhance-
ment of meaning ”), I have “ nowhere scrupled to re-write’
a sentence or a passage on judging it susceptible of a better
turn.”
To re-read “ Roderick Hudson ” was to find one remark
so promptly and so urgently prescribed that I could at once
only take it as pointing almost too stern a moral. It stared
me in the face that the time-scheme of the story is quite

X111

just fails to wreck it. The thing escapes, I conceive, with
its life : the effect sought is fortunately more achieved than
missed, since the interest of the subject bears down, auspi-
ciously dissimulates, this particular Haw in the treatment.
Everything occurs, none the less, too punctually and moves
too fast : Roderick’s disintegration, a gradual p1‘<?C<fSS» and
of which the exhibitional interest is exactly that it zs grad-
ual and occasional, and thereby traceable and watchable,
swallows two years in a mouthful, proceeds quite not by i
years, but by weeks and months, and thus renders the whole
view the disservice of appearing to present him as a morbtdly
special case. The very claim of the fable is naturally that
he is special, that his great gift makes and keeps him highly
exceptional; but that is not for a moment supposed to pre-
clude his appearing typical (of the general type) as well; for
the fictive hero successfully appeals to us only as an eminent
instance, as eminent as we like, of our own conscious kind.
My mistake on Roderick’s behalf -- and not in the least of
conception, but of composition and expression- is that, at
the rate at which he falls to pieces, he seems to place him-
self beyond our understanding and our sympathy. These
are not our rates, we say; we ourselves certainly, under like
pressure, - for what is it after all F - would make more of
a light. We conceive going to pieces -nothing is easier,
since We see people do it, one Way or another, all round
us; but this young man must either have had less of the
principle of development to have had so much of the prin-
ciple of collapse, or less of the principle of collapse to have
had so much of the principle of development. “ Un the
basis of so great a weakness,” one hears the reader say,
“ where was your idea of the interest P On the basis of so
great an interest, where is the provision for so much weak-
ness ? ” One feels indeed, in the light of this challenge, on
how much too scantly projected and suggested a field poor 2
Roderick and his large capacity for ruin are made to turn
round. It has all begun too soon, as I say, and too simply,
and the determinant function attributed to Christina Light,

XIV

PREFACE

the character of well-nigh sole agent of his catastrophe that
this unfortunate young woman has forced upon her, fails to
commend itself to our sense of truth and proportion.
It was not, however, that I was at ease on this score even
in the first fond good faith of composition; I felt too, all
the while, how many more ups and downs, how many more
adventures and complications my young man would have
had to know, how much more experience it would have
taken, in short, either to make him go under or to make
him triumph. The greater complexity, the superior truth,
was all more or less present to me; only the question was,
too dreadfully, how make it present to the reader? How
boil down so many facts in the alembic, so that the distilled
result, the produced appearance, should have intensity, lucid-
ity, brevity, beauty, all the merits required for my effect?
How, when it was already so difficult, as I found, to pro-
ceed even as I was proceeding? It did n’t help, alas, it only
maddened, to remember that Balzac would have known
how, and would have yet asked no additional credit for it.
All the difliculty I could dodge still struck me, at any rate,
as leaving more than enough; and yet I was already con-
sciously in presence, here, of the most interesting question
the artist has to consider. To give the image and the sense
of certain things while still keeping them subordinate to his
plan, keeping them in relation to matters more immediate
and apparent, to give all the sense, in a word, without all '
the substance or all the surface, and so to summarise and
foreshorten, so to make values both rich and sharp, that the
mere procession of items and profiles is not only, for the
occasion, superseded, but is, for essential quality, almost
“ compromised ” - such a case of delicacy proposes itself
at every turn to the painter of life who wishes both to treat
his chosen subject and to confine his necessary picture. It
is only by doing such things that art becomes exquisite, and
it is only by positively becoming exquisite that it keeps clear
of becoming vulgar, repudiates the coarse industries that
masquerade in its name._ This eternal time-question is
accordingly, for the novelist, always there and always for-

XV

midable ; always insisting on the #mt of the great lapse and
passage, of the “ dark backward and abysm,” by the terms
of truth, and on the effect of compression, of compoS1t10n
and form, by the terms of literary arrangement. It IS really
a business to terrify all but stout hearts into abject OITIISSIOH
and mutilation, though the terror would indeed be IDOFC
general were the general consciousness of the difficulty
greater. It is not by consciousness of diHiculty,1n truth,
that the story-teller is mostly ridden; so prodigious a num-
ber of stories would otherwise scarce get themselves (shall
it be called F) “ told.” None was ever very well told, I
think, under the law of mere elimination - inordinately as
that device appears in many quarters to be depended on.
I remember doing my best not to be reduced to it for
“ Roderick,” at the same time that I did so helplessly and
consciously beg a thousand questions. What I clung to as
my principle of simplification was the precious truth that
I was dealing, after all, essentially with an Action, and that
no action, further, was ever made historically vivid without
acertain factitious compactness; though this logic indeed
opened up horizons and abysses of its own. But into these
we must plunge on some other occasion. A
It was at any rate under an admonition or two fished out
of their depths that I must have tightened my hold of the c
remedy afforded, such as it was, for the absence of those
more adequate illustrations of Roderick’s character and his-
tory. Since one was dealing with an Action one might I
borrow a scrap of the Dramatist’s all-in-all, his intensity \
1 --which the novelist so often ruefully envies him as a for-
~ tune in itself. The amount of illustration I could allow to
the grounds of my young man’s disaster was unquestionably
meagre, but I might perhaps make it lively; I might pro-
duce illusion if I should be able to achieve intensity. It was
for that I must have tried, I now see, with such art as I
C0Uld Command; but I make out in another quarter above
all what really saved me. My subject, all blissfully, in face
of d1Hicult1es, had defined itself --and this in spite ofthe titlg
of the book---as not d1rectly, in the least, my young S¢u1p-

XVI

tor’s adventure. This it had been but indirectly, being all the
while in essence and in final effect another man’s, his  
friend’s and patron’s, view and experience of' him. OIlC’S
luck was to have felt one’s subject right --~ whether instinct
or calculation, in those dim days, most served; and the cir-
cumstance even amounts perhaps to a little lesson that when
this has happily occurred faults may show, faults may dis-
figure, and yet not upset the work. It remains in equilib-
rium by having found its centre, the point of command of
all the rest. From this centre the subject has been treated,
from this centre the interest has spread, and so, whatever
else it may do or may not do, the thing has acknowledged
a principle of composition and contrives at least to hang to-
gether. We see in such a case why it should so hang; we
escape that dreariest displeasure it is open to experiments
in this general order to inflict, the sense of any hanging-
together precluded as by the very terms of the case.
The centre of interest throughout “ Roderick” is in
Rowland Mallet’s consciousness, and the drama is the very
drama of that consciousness---which I had of course to
make sufficiently acute in order to enable it, like a set and
lighted scene, to hold the play. By making it acute, mean-
while, one made its own movement-or rather, strictly,
its movement in the particular connexion-interesting;
this movement really being quite the stuff of one’s thesis. »
It had, naturally, Rowlancl’s consciousness, not to be too
acute--which would have disconnected it and made it
superhuman: the beautiful little problem was to keep it
connected, connected intimately, with the general human
exposure, and thereby bedimmed and befooled and bewil-
dered, anxious, restless, fallible, and yet to endow it with
such intelligence that the appearances reflected in it, and
constituting together there the situation and the “ story,”
should become by that fact intelligible. Discernible from
the first the joy of such a “ job” as»this making of his re-
lation to everything involved a sufliciently limited, a suffi-
ciently pathetic, tragic, comic, ironic, pergonal State to bg
thoroughly natural, and yet at the same time a sufficiently

XVII _

f\
clear medium to represent a whole. This whole was to be
the sum of what “ happened ” to him, or in other W01°ds
his total adventure ; but as what happened to him was above
all to feel certain things happening to others, to Roderick,
to Christina, to Mary Garland, to Mrs. Hudson, to the
Cavaliere, to the Prince, so the beauty of the constructional
game was to preserve in everything its especial value for
/Jim. The ironic effect of his having fallen in love with
the girl who is herself in love with Roderick, though. he IS
unwitting, at the time, of that secret -- the conception of
this last irony, I must add, has remained happier than my
execution of it; which should logically have involved the
reader’s being put into position to take more closely home
the impression made by Mary Garland. The ground has
not been laid for it, and when that is the case one builds
all vainly in the air: one patches up one’s superstructure,
one paints it in the prettiest colours, one hangs Hne old
tapestry and rare brocade over its window-sills, one Hies
emblazoned banners from its roof -- the building none the
less totters and refuses to stand square.
It is not really worked-in that Roderick himself could
have pledged his faith in such a quarter, much more at such
acrisis, before leaving America: and that Weakness, clearly,
produces a limp in the whole march of the fable. Just so,
though there Was no reason on earth (unless I except one,
presently to be mentioned) why Rowland should not, at
Northampton, have conceived a passion, or as near an ap-
proach to one as he was capable of, for a remarkable young
woman there suddenly dawning on his sight, a particular
fundamental care was required for the vivilication of that
possibility. The care, unfortunately, has not been skilfully
enough taken, in spite of the later patching-up of the girl’s
figure. We fail to accept it, on the actual showing, as that
of a young person irresistible at any moment and above all
. . . _ _ 1 _
irresistible at a moment of the liveliest at/Jer preoccupation
as that of the Weaver of (even the highly conditioned) spell
that the n ° °

is cast upon young men b

ways, and the novel has no more constant oflice than to
remind us of that. But Mary Garland’s way does n’t, in-
dubitably, convince us; any more than we are truly con-
vinced, I think, that Rowland’s destiny, or say his nature,
would have made him accessible at the same hour to two
quite distinct commotions, each a very deep one, of his
whole personal economy. Rigidly viewed, each of these ‘
upheavals of his sensibility must have been exclusive of
other upheavals, yet the reader is asked to accept them as
working together. They are different vibrations, but the
whole sense of the situation depicted is that they should
each have been of the strongest, too strong to walk hand in
hand. Therefore it is that when, on the ship, under the
stars, Roderick suddenly takes his friend into the confidence
of his engagement, we instinctively disallow the friend’s
title to discomfiture. The whole picture presents him as
for the time on the mounting wave, exposed highly enough,
no doubt, to a hundred discomfitures, but least exposed to
that one. The damage to verisimilitude is deep.
The difliculty had been from the first that I required my
antithesis-my antithesis to Christina Light, one of the
main terms of the subject. Une is ridden by the law that
antitheses, to be efficient, shall be both direct and complete.
Directness seemed to fail unless Mary should be, so to
speak, “ plain,” Christina being essentially so “ coloured ”;
and completeness seemed to fail unless she too should have
her potency. She could moreover, by which I mean the
antithetic young woman could, perfectly have had it; only
success would have been then in the narrator’s art to attest
it. Christina’s own presence and action are, on the other
hand,I think, all firm ground; the truth probably being
that the ideal antithesis rarely does “ come off,” and that it
has to content itself for the most part with a strong term
and a Weak term, and even then to feel itself lucky. If one
of the terms is strong, that perhaps may pass, in the most
diflicult of the arts, for a triumph. Iremember at all events
feeling, toward the end* of “ Roderick,” that the Princess
Casamassima had been launched, that, wound-up with the

right silver key, she would go on a certain time by the mo-
tion communicated; thanks to which I knew the pity, the
real pang of losing sight of her. I desired as in no other
such case I can recall to preserve, to recover the vision;
and I have seemed to myself in re-reading the book quite
to understand why. The multiplication of touches had
produced even more life than the subject required, and that
life, in other conditions, in some other prime relation, would
still have somehow to be spent. Thus one would watch
for her and waylay her at some turn of the road to come -
all that was to be needed was to give her time. This I did
in fact, meeting her again and taking her up later on.
